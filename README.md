# What Beatles Album?

## Description

With so much incredible music, it can be difficult at times to choose what Beatles album to listen to. This is a simple application which displays the album cover art of a random Beatles album to help aid in your decision making.

This app was developed as part of my journey learning Flutter and Dart. It uses state to rebuild the application every time the album image, which is a button, is clicked. This is accomplished by placing part of the app's structure in a stateless widget, and the body of the app that needs to change within a stateful widget.

It also uses dart math in order to pull a random number which aids in displaying a random Beatles album.

I will be returning to this application in the future to add additional features to it.
